# ⚽ La Liga 24/25 Season Analysis | Python & Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a statistical analysis of the previous La Liga season (2024/2025). The main objective was to evaluate team form, offensive effectiveness, and defensive statistics. The project also investigates the hypothesis regarding the "Home Advantage" phenomenon.

The workflow follows a standard data analysis process: starting with **Data Cleaning & Preparation**, moving through **Feature Engineering**, and concluding with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization.

## 🎯 Key insights
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions has been made:
1.  **FC Barcelona offensive dominance**
    * Barcelona scored the highest number of goals in the league, maintaining a significant advantage over the runner-up, Real Madrid.
2.  **Correlation between Shots & Goals:**
   * A strong positive correlation exists between shots attempted and goals scored. Teams positioned above the trend line demonstrate higher finishing efficiency compared to the league average.
3.  **Home Advantage Analysis:**
    * The data suggests that playing at home does not guarantee a significant advantage for all teams. While some clubs perform better at home, others have secured more points in away matches.
4.  **Form Analysis (Rolling Average):**
    * The rolling average chart highlights the momentum of the top two clubs: FC Barcelona and Real Madrid. Both teams experienced a noticeable dip in form during the second quarter of the season.

## 🛠️ Użyte Technologie (Tech Stack)

* **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation, grouping, statistical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization
* **Google Colab:** Development environment
